### Hello there

My name is Spiridon Konofaos, and I aspire to be the best web designer and developer that I can possibly be. I really enjoy using CSS and SASS to bring my projects to life, always staying up to date with the latest rules of design, and concentrating on UI design, WordPress, and just web development in general.  I try to make my HTML and SCC code as readable and understandable as I possibly can be. You can check out my portfolio and all the projects I've done at https://spiridonko.me/.
